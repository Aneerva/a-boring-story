Once upon a time, there was a monkey who lived on a berry tree which was on the banks of the river. In he same forest lived a crocodile and his wife. 
One day, the crocoidle wanders deep into the river and comes to rest under the berry tree, on which the monkey lived. 
The crocodile, having swum up quite a distance, was tired and hungry. 
The kind monkey sees that the crocodile is hungry and shares the berries with him.
